      <p class="nneka">Nneka wants every woman to know she is naturally beautiful—and she does that through her Namaste Natural Beauty product business, which she founded in 2016.
Gunn, who is originally from Chattanooga, Tennessee, and now lives in Hoover,AL said she came up with the name after practicing yoga for 10 years: “Namaste is a greeting we use. It means ‘I bow to you.’”
“So, Namaste Natural Beauty means ‘I bow to the natural beauty that is you.’”</p>
<p class="nneka">Gunn started this venture through the Co.Starters business development program with REV Birmingham, “an economic development organization that stimulates business growth and improves quality of life in Birmingham,” according to revbirmingham.org.
The inspiration to make her own products, however, came from her family.“My mom and grandma had beautiful skin. … When I got to be a teenager and started getting acne, I would be like, ‘What are y’all doing [to have beautiful skin]?’ So, my mom would make us homemade masks, and everything [in the mask] was from the kitchen or garden. My grandmother had this saying, ‘Everything we need to heal and nourish ourselves, the Earth provides.’”
Gunn, remembered her grandmother’s sage words when she went natural more than 10 years ago and had a tough time finding natural hair products.
“I went through all kinds of products,” she said. “I tried all these high-end products and nothing worked. I started researching what would work with my hair and discovered shea butter. I was like, ‘Oh, my hair loves this!’ It morphed from there.”
Over the years, Gunn formulated different products using all-natural ingredients: “I love going to farmer’s markets. I would find a lot of ingredients for my hair there.”
When she moved to Birmingham from Atlanta two years ago to be closer to her family, Gunn began sharing her products with her father.
“It was primarily the skin products,” she said. “He said, ‘These are really good.’ I was giving them away as gifts, and then one day my dad said, ‘You really need to be selling these.’ That’s when I met Kathleen Hamrick, [director of the University of Alabama at Birmingham iLab] at Innovation Depot. She introduced me to Deon Gordon, [REV director of business growth], who works with Co.Starters.”
Through Co.Starters, Gunn was able to do a long-term market study.</p>

“My [colleagues] gave me really good feedback,” she said. “When I started Namaste Natural Beauty, my goal was to have products for women of color. Even though we are the biggest consumers of beauty products, there isn’t a lot out there for us.”
She learned that her products work well for more than just black women, though.
“I had some [colleagues] who wanted to try the products, and I told them, ‘I don’t know what’s going to happen with your hair.’ But I found that the products were beneficial for Caucasian women, as well,” she said.</p>
